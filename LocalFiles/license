Simple stopwatch application showcasing various features of the Mosync NativeUI,
including labels, layouts and buttons.

The application has two main parts: JavaScript functions and the HTML structure.
The JavaScript is also divided into files, user interface and timer functions,
for easier comprehension.

Index.html walks through the steps of setting up the NativeUI,
from initialization to display and then finally to interaction.
HTML is used to structure the applications various elements using
standard <div> tags with custom attributes, while the JavaScript
handles more complicated task like determining the correct font size.

Stopwatch.js contains the stopwatch specific functions like start, pause, round and reset,
as well as time and string formatting.
